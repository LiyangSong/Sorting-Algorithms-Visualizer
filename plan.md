# Project Plan

### Objective

Use React to develop an interative webpage showing sorting algorithm dynamically.

Related algorithms: Selection Sort, Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Heap Sort, Tree Sort, etc.

### Timeline

- 4/28 - 4/30 Learn background knowledge. Learn React.
- 4/30 - 5/1 Build Framework.
- 5/2 - 5/8 Development. (complete at least 1-2 algorithms)
- 5/9 - 5/10 Documentation.
- 5/12 - 5/30 Implement other functions.

### Expected Features

- Allow for user inputs of numbers:
  - Number digits can be 1, 2, or 3.
  - Number of numbers can be extended by users. Default 3 numbers.

- Generate shapes containing user-input numbers:
  - Each shape should have activated state to show different style. 
  - Each shape should have x and y position to show their order in algorithms.

- Animations to show the change of shape positions:
  - Buttons to control progressï¼š next step, last step, autoplay, speed, etc.
