# Summer-Project

Use React to develop a Web that dynamically shows sorting algorithms.

Related sorting algorithms: Bubble sort, Quick Sort, Merge sort, Selection Sort, Insertion sort, Heap sort, etc.

# Reproducibility

- Install `Node.js` (our version is 18.16.0)
- `npm install`: Install required modules
- `npm start`: Start the development server. The webpage should open automatically in the default web browser. If not, navigate to `http://localhost:3000` in the web browser to view it.
- `Ctrl/Command + C`: Stop the development server
